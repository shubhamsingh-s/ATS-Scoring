This PR adds comprehensive deployment infrastructure for the ATS Scoring System with automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Changes Made

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Frontend Deployment**: Auto-deploys vanilla frontend to Netlify on main branch push
- **Backend Deployment Options**:
  - Netlify Functions (recommended serverless option)
  - Render (alternative full server deployment)

### Backend Configuration
- Added Netlify Functions setup with `serverless-http` wrapper
- Created `netlify/functions/api.js` for serverless deployment
- Added `netlify.toml` configuration for functions
- Added Render deployment configuration (`render.yaml`)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive deployment guide (`README.deploy.md`)
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- GitHub secrets configuration
- Troubleshooting section

### Dependencies
- Added `serverless-http` to backend package.json
- Fixed Netlify CLI compatibility for Node.js v16

## Deployment Options

### Frontend (Netlify Static Site)
- Auto-deploys from `main` branch
- Uses `tools/write-env.js` for API URL injection
- Static hosting with global CDN

### Backend (Choose One)

#### Option 1: Netlify Functions (Recommended)
- Serverless Express.js deployment
- API endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/api`
- Auto-deploys on backend changes
- Cost-effective for low-medium traffic

#### Option 2: Render
- Full Express.js server deployment
- Traditional hosting approach
- More control over server configuration

## Required Setup

### GitHub Repository Secrets
```
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
NETLIFY_SITE_ID (frontend)
NETLIFY_BACKEND_SITE_ID (backend, if using Netlify Functions)
API_URL (backend URL for frontend)
RENDER_API_KEY (if using Render)
RENDER_SERVICE_ID (if using Render)
```

### Database Configuration
- MySQL database (AWS RDS, PlanetScale, etc.)
- Update environment variables in deployment platform

## Next Steps After Merge
1. Create Netlify sites for frontend and backend
2. Set up GitHub repository secrets
3. Configure database and environment variables
4. Push to `main` to trigger automatic deployments
5. Test deployed application

This infrastructure provides production-ready deployment with automated CI/CD, multiple hosting options, and comprehensive documentation.
