# TODO: Update "Get Started" Button to "Start Scan" and Redirect to model.html

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Edit ats-scoring/frontend-vanilla/index.html to change button text from "Get Started" to "Start Scan" and href from "login.html" to "model.html"
- [x] Test the change: Launch browser to index.html, click the "Start Scan" button, and verify it redirects to model.html without errors
- [x] Confirm button design remains blue with rounded edges and white text (no CSS changes needed)
- [x] Ensure accessibility and mobile-friendliness (already handled by existing CSS and HTML structure)

## Notes
- No JavaScript required; using simple anchor link redirect.
- Critical-path testing: Focus on button update and redirect functionality.
